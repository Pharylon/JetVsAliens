If you wish to compile this, you will need Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 Refresh (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599) as well as Visual Stuidio 2010 (XNA is not supported in VS 2012!). You can download the express version of Visual Studio here if you do not already have it: (http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express).
